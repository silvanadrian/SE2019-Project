\subsection{Identify Boundary Conditions}
    \subsubsection{System boot}
    A \texttt{Supervisor} or \texttt{Caseworker} starts the \texttt{Case manager Server}, as soon as the Servers initialization is complete. Then the applicants, supervisors and caseworkers can initiate any of their use cases. 
    
    \subsubsection{System shutdown}
    A \texttt{Supervisor} or \texttt{Caseworker} stops the \texttt{Case manager Server}, any still ongoing cases (in creation of applicants) will be stored.
    As soon as the shutdown complete it won't be possible to create or modify any cases anymore.
