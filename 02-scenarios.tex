\subsection*{Application approved}
\begin{table}[htb!]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l|X}
	\textbf{Scenario name} & Application approved \\

	\textbf{Flow of events} &
	\begin{compactenum}
			\item Alice, a parent, has a child with a serious chronic illness. She logs into the OCM system as a citizen, fills out a form, attaches any relevant documentation and submits the application. There does not exist any prior applications from Alice, so the system annotates it as a new case.
			\item The system assigns the application to caseworker Bob. He logs into the system as a caseworker. He picks Alice's application from an overview of assigned cases. He validates documentation authenticity and data entered in form by Alice. He approves and submits the application.
			\item The system assigns the application to another caseworker Charles. He processes the application in the same manner as Bob and submits it once it is approved.
			\item With approvals from two random caseworkers, the system annotate the case as approved and calculates the compensation based on the data contained in the application. The system sends a response to Alice's e-mail that her application was approved, including the details regarding her compensation. The system archives the case.

	\begin{compactenum}
	       \item Alice is a parent that has a child suffering from fever. She logs into the OCM system as a citizen, fills out the application form, attaches any relevant documentation and submits the application. There does not exist any prior applications from Alice, hence the system annotates it as a new case.
           \item  The system assigns the application to caseworker Bob. He logs into the system as a caseworker. He picks Alice's application from an overview of assigned cases. He validates documentation authenticity. The applicant is not eligible for compensation, so he rejects and submits the application.
           \item The system assigns the application to another caseworker Charles. He concludes the same as Bob. Charles also rejects and submits the application.
	        \item With rejections from two random caseworkers, the system annotate the case as rejected. The system sends a response to Alice's e-mail that her application was rejected. The system archives the case.

	        \item Alice, a parent, has a child with an ambiguous illness in the context of "loss of earnings" legislation. She logs into the OCM system as a citizen, fills out a form, attaches any relevant documentation and submits the application. There does not exist any prior applications from Alice, so the system annotates it as a new case.
	        \item The system assigns the application to caseworker Bob. He logs into the system as a caseworker. He picks Alice's application from an overview of assigned cases. He validates documentation authenticity and data entered in form by Alice. He approves and submits the application.
	        \item The system assigns the application to another caseworker Charles. He validates documentation authenticity and data entered in form by Alice. He rejects and submits the application.
	        \item With an approval and rejection, the system assigns the application to yet another caseworker Diana. She validates documentation authenticity and data entered in form by Alice. She approves and submits the application.
	        \item With approvals from two random caseworkers, the system annotate the case as approved and calculates the compensation based on the data contained in the application. The system sends a response to Alice's e-mail that her application was approved, including the details regarding her compensation. The system archives the case.

	        \item The system assigns the application to caseworker Bob. He logs into the system as a caseworker. He picks Alice's application from an overview of assigned cases. The application is filled out inadequately, so he writes an e-mail to Alice and inquire about missing information. He sets the case on hold and waits for a response from applicant.
	        \item Alice fills out the missing data and submits the changes. 
	        \item Bob resumes its progress and approves the application and submit it to the system.
	        \item The system assigns the application to another caseworker Charles. The case now contains the additional information added by Bob. Charles validate the contained data, approves the application and submits it.
	        \item With approvals from two random caseworkers, the system annotate the case as approved and calculates the compensation based on the data contained in the application. The system sends a response to Alice's e-mail that her application was approved, including the details regarding her compensation. The system archives the case.

            \item The system assigns the application to another caseworker Charles. He also approves the application without validating its contents and submits it.
            \item With approvals from two random caseworkers, the system annotate the case as approved and calculates the compensation based on the data contained in the application.

She logs into the OCM system as a citizen and fills out a form, attaches any relevant documentation and submits the application. There exist prior applications from Alice, so the system annotates it as a duplicate case.
	        \item The system assigns the application to caseworker Bob. He logs into the system as a caseworker. He picks Alice's application from an overview of assigned cases. He approves without noticing this is a duplicate case and submits the application.
