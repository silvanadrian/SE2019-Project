\section{Conclusion}

Throughout the project we had the idea of introducing a major voting feature (at least 2 approved or rejected votes from Caseworkers), but this was in the end a little over engineered.
Since technically in a small municipality there can be only a single Caseworker, which would then himself do the second approve or reject vote.
So we ended up reducing the complexity of the project quite a lot by making it much easier to reject or approve cases.

We are aware that the system modelled in this document is bare-bones, i.e. only containing the minimum features in order to model the possible workflow of a "loss of earnings" application system. The system could be extended with different quality-of-life features like, the ability for caseworkers to leave notes in cases.
