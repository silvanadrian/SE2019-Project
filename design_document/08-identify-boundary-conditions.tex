\subsection{Identify Boundary Conditions}
    \subsubsection{System boot}
    A \texttt{Supervisor} has boot privileges for the \texttt{Case manager server}. The external services \texttt{Calculator}, \texttt{User management} and \texttt{Email Notifications}, must be running prior to server boot. The server establishes connection to the services through parameters set in server configuration.
    
    \subsubsection{System shutdown}
    A \texttt{Supervisor} has shutdown privileges for the \texttt{Case manager server}. The application submission portal is shutdown first, closing access for applicants to submit any additional cases. The caseworker portal broadcasts a server shutdown notice for a set amount of time, to allow caseworkers to finish any ongoing work. Once both clients are taken offline, the server can be shutdown.
