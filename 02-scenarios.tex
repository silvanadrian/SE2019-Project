			\item Alice, a parent, has a child with a serious chronic illness. She logs into the system as a citizen, fills out a form, attaches any relevant documentation and submits the application.
			\item There does not exist any prior applications from Alice, so the system sets the case to ongoing. The system assigns the application to caseworker Bob.
			\item Bob logs into the system as a caseworker. He picks Alice's application from an overview of assigned cases. He validates documentation authenticity and data entered in form by Alice. He finally approves the application.
			\item The system annotates the case as approved and calculates the compensation based on the data contained in the application. The system sends a response to Alice's e-mail that her application was approved, including the details regarding her compensation. The system archives the case.

	       \item There does not exist any prior applications from Alice, so the system sets the case to ongoing. The system assigns the application to caseworker Bob.
	       \item Bob logs into the system as a caseworker. He picks Alice's application from an overview of assigned cases. He validates documentation authenticity. The applicant is not eligible for compensation, so he rejects the application.
	        \item The system annotates the case as rejected. The system sends a response to Alice's e-mail that her application was rejected. The system archives the case.

	\begin{compactenum}
	        \item Alice, a parent, has a child with a serious chronic illness. She logs into the system as a citizen, fills out a form inadequately and submits the application.
	        \item There does not exist any prior applications from Alice, so the system annotates it as a new case. The system assigns the application to caseworker Bob.
	        \item He logs into the system as a caseworker. He picks Alice's application from an overview of assigned cases. The application is filled out inadequately, so he writes an e-mail to Alice and inquire about missing information. He sets the case on hold and waits for a response from applicant.
	        \item Alice accesses her case through a link in the e-mail. She fills out the missing data and submits the changes.
	        \item Bob validates the newly added data. He resumes the case progress and approves the application.
	        \item The system annotate the case as approved and calculates the compensation based on the data contained in the application. The system sends a response to Alice's e-mail that her application was approved, including the details regarding her compensation. The system archives the case.

    \begin{compactenum}
	        \item Alice, a parent, has forgot she already receives "loss of earnings" compensation for her child. She logs into the OCM system as a citizen and fills out a form, attaches any relevant documentation and submits the application. There exist prior applications from Alice, so the system annotates it as a duplicate case.
	        \item The system assigns the application to caseworker Bob. He logs into the system as a caseworker. He picks Alice's application from an overview of assigned cases. He detects that the case is actually a duplicate and rejects the application.
	        \item The system annotate the case as rejected. The system sends a response to Alice's e-mail that her application was rejected. The system archives the case.
